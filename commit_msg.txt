5A - Refactoring and performance. Bug fixes.

Changes:
    Performance:
    - Components now re-use surfaces
    - Enabled hardware acceleration when available
    - Blit lists are now cached
    - Text is now cached
    - Migrated from pygame to pygame-ce for performance improvements
    - Implemented render-on-change architecture across all components
    - Removed expensive composite surface system from base.py
    - Added high-precision timing using time.perf_counter in window.py
    - Implemented fblits batch rendering for better performance
    - Added viewport culling to reduce unnecessary blits
    - Enhanced text rendering with cached_render utility function
    - Added comprehensive slots to all component classes for memory optimization
    - Simplified component rendering to reduce draw calls
    - Reduced surface creation overhead
    - Optimized text rendering with caching
    - Improved event processing efficiency
    - Added viewport culling for off-screen elements
    - Switched to pygame-ce fblits for batch rendering
    - High-precision deltatime measurement
    - Memory optimizations with __slots__

    Bugfixes:
    - Fixed multiple field input
    - Fixed event bleed-through
    - Fixed event processing order
    - Fixed progress bar visual updates with immediate display

    Features:
    - Added TabFrame component for tab-based interfaces
